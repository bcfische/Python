PyBank

Here, we create a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a fictional company. The dataset resides in budget_data.csv and is
composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. The Python script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
~The total number of months included in the dataset
~The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
~The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
~The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
~The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period


PyPoll

Here, we are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. Given is a set of poll data called
election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. The goal is to create a Python script that 
analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
~The total number of votes cast

~The percentage of votes each candidate won
~The total number of votes each candidate won
~The winner of the election based on popular vote
